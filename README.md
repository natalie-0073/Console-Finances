# Financial Analysis Project
This project involves analyzing financial data represented as an array containing monthly profits from January 2010 to February 2017.

## Overview
I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

My task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

-The total number of months included in the dataset.

-The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

-The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

-The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

-The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.
